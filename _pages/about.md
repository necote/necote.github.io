Nicole Cote is a doctoral candidate at The Graduate Center CUNY, whose work centers on the production of public knowledge and understandings of disaster through the lens of media and information, the history of technology, art, and STS. She is currently investigating the historical and contemporary entanglements of media, technology, and cultural work that shape how “natural” disasters are understood in the public sphere--and how they might be refigured. She also works widely on applied digital media and digital humanities projects and teaches digital skills. 

Nicole is currently a [Dissertation Fellow](https://artscienceconnect.gc.cuny.edu/awards-and-fellows/) with the Art Science Connect Initiative, an [Advisor](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/people/#adv) for the MA in Digital Humanities Program at The Graduate Center, and an [Affiliate](https://citap.unc.edu/about/affiliates/) with the Center for Information, Technology, and Public Life (CITAP) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. 

She was recently a [Research Fellow](https://www.lindahall.org/research/linda-hall-library-fellowships/former-fellows/former-fellows-2022-2023#Nicole-Cote) at the Linda Hall Library of Science, Engineering, and Technology, and has been a [Digital Fellow](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/people/), [Data for Public Good Fellow](https://dataforgood.commons.gc.cuny.edu/fellows/), and [Open Pedagogy Fellow](https://openpedagogy.commons.gc.cuny.edu/winter-2021-fellows/) at CUNY, as well as a [Researcher](https://newmedialab.cuny.edu/person/nicole-cote/) at the New Media Lab. Nicole's research has been generously supported by the Linda Hall Library, New York City Digital Humanities Organization (NYCDH), and various offices and institutes at CUNY. 

In Spring 2024 Nicole will serve as an [Adjunct Lecturer](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/digital-humanities/curriculum-and-degree-information/courses) in the MA Program in Digital Humanities and MS Program in Data Analysis and Visualization at The Graduate Center, where she will teach a course on interactive data visualization. She has previously served as a [Visiting Assistant Professor](https://www.pratt.edu/people/nicole-cote/) in the MS Program in Data Analytics and Visualization at the Pratt Institute School of Information. 

Nicole holds an MS from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and an MSc by Research from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Literatures, Languages, and Cultures.
