The [GC Digital Dissertations Resource Guide](https://digitaldiss.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) is a collaborative project co-created with Di Yoong and Zachary Lloyd and is part of Graduate Center Digital Initiatives at CUNY.

### Project Description

Over the past 20 years, digital dissertations have become options for generating critical and creative interdisciplinary alternatives to the traditional monograph. Digital dissertations might include incorporating digital methods in a traditional monograph, adding a project site, developing a database, assembling an archive, composing a non-linear digital text, plotting a digital map, recording sound or video for podcasts or analysis, creating digital artwork, building a video game & etc.â€“the options are endless. Practice-led research and critical making endeavors challenge traditional forms of knowledge production while opening up research topics to new possibilities. This site is a resource for GC PhD students interested in or currently pursuing digital dissertations, as well as staff, faculty, and administrators supporting such student work. The site is organized by project stage. Visitors can also navigate to a consolidated list of resources. The project includes a podcast series with students, faculty, and librarians about digital dissertations at the CUNY Graduate Center.
