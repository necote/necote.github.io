### Project Description

[VisDepot: An Introductory Resource for Data Visualization](https://necote.github.io/VisDepot/landing.html) is an introductory repository of tools, concepts, and tutorials for visualization. It is introductory in that it assumes no prior data or visualization knowledge, but can be useful for those with experience as well. This resource is a curated meeting place of various tools and materials for getting you started on a project, and others for picking-up later on or tweaking projects as they develop. It is a repository of materials to be shared. The goal is to point newcomers to helpful material for getting started in the visualization field (including how to source, manipulate, and visualize data), and those more experienced with a broader sense of where to look for more freely available information.

This resource is a recipient of the "First Prize" for the 2021-2022 NYCDH Digital Humanities Graduate Student Project Award and the 2021 New Media Lab Dewey Digital Teaching Award. It is also a 2021 Digital Humanities Awards nominee in the category of Best DH Training Materials.
