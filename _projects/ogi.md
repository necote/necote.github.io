### Project Description

Off Grid Investigations (OGI) is a critical exploration in off-grid
technology that seeks to problematize and speculate around the ways these
tools operate as disaster technologies and for
the narratives such media produce. By exploring
through technological production, it uses solar power as its initial
lens.   

OGI, a work-in-progress, stands on the shoulders of existing
innovative creative solar projects like [Solar
Protocol](http://solarprotocol.net/), [Low Tech
Magazine](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html), and [Solar
Powered Media](https://wp.nyu.edu/solarpoweredmedia/). So too is it
reliant on important discussions and work concerning [minimal
computing](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000646/000646.html)
and [low carbon
methods](http://lowcarbonmethods.com/local/index.html). OGI, however,
relates more specifically to my work in disaster studies. With this
critical-making investigative project I aim to open-up discussions
around the tools preparedness cultures advocate for, the reliance on
information infrastructures that are fallible in times of crisis, and
possibilities and questions for imagining different futures that make
use of off-grid tools.

This project has been supported in part by Graduate Center Digital
Initiatives at CUNY.
